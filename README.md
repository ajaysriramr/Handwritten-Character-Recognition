# Final Project

This is a **group assignment**.

## Milestone 2 - Code Implementation & Technical Report

This milestone is to be delivered at the end of the semester, Friday April 22 @ 11:59 PM. Find the complete [rubric](https://ufl.instructure.com/courses/447948/assignments/5138679) in the Canvas assignemtn.

## Training Data

The training data set is the same for every team in this course.

You can download the data in our Canvas page:
* ["data_train.npy"](https://ufl.instructure.com/courses/447948/files/folder/Final%20Project?preview=67069006)
* ["labels_train.npy"](https://ufl.instructure.com/courses/447948/files/folder/Final%20Project?preview=67068769)

## Dependencies

1. NumPy
2. MatplotLib
3. Tensorflow
4. Scikit-learn
5. Scikit-Image
6. PIL
7. Pandas
8. Itertools
9. Keras 
10. import_ipynb

## Code Flow
* To run the easy test set, run “Test.ipynb”. Make the file name changes as mentioned in the comments.
* The weights have been saved as “final_model_with_norm.h5”. This is used in Test file. To retrain and regenerate the weights, run “Train.ipynb” which will create the new model. The function train in “Train.ipynb” allows the user to change certain hyperparameters.
